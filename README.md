Shakespeare is renowned for his eloquent and poetic writing style. This project utilizes the concepts of word embeddings and LSTM networks to capture the linguistic patterns and nuances found in Shakespeare's works. By training a language model on his texts, we can generate new text that resembles his distinctive writing style.
